                        A Swiss tournament will be played between all entrants (except for PepsiNGaming
                        and GrohochetGrom). Each participant plays a 10-game match per round.
                        A won game gives 1 point, a tie (5-5) gives 0.5 points, and
                        a lost game gives 0 points. Once either player reaches 5.5 in a match, the
                        players are allowed to stop there.
                    </li>
                    <li>The number of rounds will be the base-2 logarithm of the number
                        of participants, rounded up, plus two. So 33-64 players is 8 rounds,
                        65-128 players is 9 rounds, etc.

                        A single-match stage in which the players ranked 5-12 in the Qualification round must play off for a

                        A double round-robin tournament among the candidates will be played, where the "upper" and "lower" pools of players are determined by placement in the previous rounds.
                        PepsiNGaming starts in the upper pool and GrohochetGrom starts in the lower pool. If PepsiNGaming does not participate, then GrohochetGrom starts in the upper pool.

                    <li>To win either match, the leading player must be ahead by two points. If there is no winner decided after 12 games, sets of 2 games will be added until there is a winner.</li>
                    <li>If, after 24 games, there is still no winner decided, the "must be ahead by two points" restriction gets dropped, and the time control becomes 3+0.</li>

    <li>Match negotiations
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Players may begin negotiating a playing start time as soon as their
                next pairing is known. When a time is agreed on, it must be shared in the
                <a href="https://lichess.org/forum/team-antichess-wc/acwc-2020-pairings-and-match-results">Pairings forum
                    post</a>.</li>
            <li>To prevent (most) timezone confusion, players must communicate their times in UTC.</li>
            <li>Each player is responsible to offer at least 3 separate times for the
                match, by Saturday at the latest, unless an offer has been accepted before
                that number is reached.</li>
            <li>The 3 offered times should be no closer than 3 hours to each other and no
                more than 2 on a single date.</li>
            <li>If 3 offers are not made in time the player at fault must accept a time
                chosen by the opponent.</li>
            <li>If both players fail to make 3 offers by the deadline then the match will count as a draw and both players will count as having forfeited a game.</li>
            <li>A player should respond to an offer by accepting or making a different
                offer, preferably within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>If both players make 3 offers but no agreement is made before the weekend
                then TDs will determine if fault lies with a particular player.</li>
            <li>If a player is at fault then their opponent will decide the match time,
                if no player is at fault then the match will be ruled as a draw.</li>
            <li>Case-by-case exceptions may be made to the aforementioned rules at the TDs' discretion.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Match rules (applying at all stages)
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Each player has the right to call a break once during the match, between two games.
                The break lasts at most 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If no break is called, a rematch must be offered and accepted immediately.
                Repeated failure in doing so leads to a forfeit.</li>
            <li>
                In the Final Matches: the same break rules apply, but because the Final Matches can take much longer than a standard match, the players are allowed to agree beforehand to split their match over several days, but only within the Final week.
            </li>
            <li>If a player is offline at the time of the match, they have a 10 minute grace period
                to come online and start the game. The appearing player has to message the TDs that their
                opponent did not show up and again 10 minutes afterwards if the opponent still didn't show up.
                The appearing player has the choice to reschedule or claim a win. If the
                appearing player does not claim a win and rescheduling fails, the match
                will be forfeited in favor of the appearing player.</li>
            <li>If a player leaves the match while it's still ongoing, they get 10 minutes to come back
                and this counts as their break. If they don't come back in time, their opponent gets the option
                to claim a win (similar to rule VI.D).</li>
            <li>If a player gets forfeited in two different matches, they get disqualified from the ACWC.</li>
            <li>After a match, either player must post the results in the
                <a href="https://lichess.org/forum/team-antichess-wc/acwc-2020-pairings-and-match-results">Pairings forum

    <li>Reporting cheats
        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                Accusations of cheating must be made privately to the TDs. Any accusation in
                public will result in a disqualification of the accuser, regardless of whether
                the accusation was correct or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an accused player is found guilty, they will be disqualified from the
                tournament.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a player gets marked as engine/booster on Lichess during the ACWC but for
                non-ACWC games, they also get disqualified from the ACWC.

                    <li>
                        If a player withdraws or gets disqualified from the Qualification, they will
                        not be included in later pairings. If they still have an uncompleted pairing,
                        their opponent wins this game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the disqualification happens on grounds of an engine mark (not booster
                        mark), all of their finished games in the Qualification will be adjudicated
                        in favor of their opponents.
                    </li>
                </ol>
